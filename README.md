# Email-Spam-detectin
a data mining project for college, detecting spam using most of the machine learning models with hyperparameter tuning
Spam Email Detection Project:
    This repository contains a comprehensive data mining project focused on detecting spam emails using various machine learning models.
    The project includes extensive experiments with multiple algorithms, hyperparameter tuning, and feature engineering to optimize performance.

Project Description:
    Spam email detection is a crucial task in email management systems to filter out unwanted messages. 
    This project explores the use of several machine learning algorithms to classify emails as spam or not spam. The following machine learning models have been employed:

        Decision Trees
        Random Forest
        Naive Bayes
        Logistic Regression
        AdaBoost
        K-Nearest Neighbors
        Support Vector Machines
        
Key aspects of the project include:
    Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for modeling.
    Feature Engineering: Creating and selecting relevant features to improve model performance.
    Model Training and Evaluation: Training various models and evaluating their performance using appropriate metrics.
    Hyperparameter Tuning: Using techniques such as Grid Search and Randomized Search to find the best parameters for each model.
    Model Comparison: Comparing the performance of different models to identify the most effective one for spam email detection.

Libraries Needed:
    The following libraries are required to run the project:

        pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
        numpy: For numerical operations
        scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms and tools
